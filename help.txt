2 thoughts on - React-native 0.65 (targetSdk=30) android build is failing because of react-native-reanimated

A temporary solution is here:
Go to the path : node_modules/react-native-reanimated/android/build.gradle

Replace below line
artifacts.add(“default”, file(“react-native-reanimated-${minor}.aar”))

TO
artifacts.add(“default”, file(“react-native-reanimated-64.aar”))

Basically, RN 0.65 stable version is recently out, So the other libraries are not maintained as per the recent requirements. You might get new release of react-native-reanimated library with support of RN 0.65.

Thanks 🙂
